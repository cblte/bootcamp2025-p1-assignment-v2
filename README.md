## Task of Part 1 v2

<blockquote>

In this first part of the Bootcamp you found several demos.

Following a demo is quite easy.

The hard part is doing the thing yourself, on your own.

What I want you to do in this first 4 weeks is think of one (or more, if you have time!) web page (just one, maybe even just a portion of it) and try to replicate it as much as you can using HTML, CSS / Tailwind.

This is not a design bootcamp, so try to think how to replicate its structure, using CSS Grid, Flexbox, maybe using plain CSS first, then Tailwind.

If you have time and you’re up for it, you can try to replicate the design. Think of it like trying to replicate a painting.

Need some examples? Try looking on this website: [https://onepagelove.com](https://onepagelove.com/), I’m sure you’ll find a page you like. Try avoiding the more “artistic” ones, and strive for simplicity first.

Show your work in Discord, it’s more fun if you share it!
